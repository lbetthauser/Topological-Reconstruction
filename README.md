# Topological-Reconstruction
Uses ties between Euler characteristic and Moebius Inversion to reconstruct a grayscale digital image from its Euler Characteristic Curve.

Code exists to reconstruct the digital image from the Persistence Barcode however; it requires third party code which is not public at this time.
